# SchemaFX: Build Without Boundaries.

SchemaFX is a new open-source, no-code/low-code platform designed to empower developers and "citizen developers" with a powerful, fast, and secure alternative to existing solutions. Our core mission is to give you complete data ownership, enhanced user privacy, and superior performance right out of the box.

## Why SchemaFX?
The current market is dominated by proprietary tools with significant drawbacks. We're building SchemaFX to solve the critical pain points we've identified:
- **Vendor Lock-in:** Unlike other platforms, SchemaFX is truly open source and can be self-hosted. This gives you complete control and ownership of your data and infrastructure, so you're never at the mercy of a single vendor.
- **Limited Performance:** We're building SchemaFX for speed from the ground up, with a tech stack optimized for high throughput and responsiveness to overcome the performance limitations of existing tools.
- **Complex Pricing:** Our open-source model and clear pricing structure provide a transparent, trustworthy, and cost-effective alternative to complex enterprise plans.

## The Tech Stack
SchemaFX is built on a modern, high-performance tech stack designed for scalability and efficiency.
- **Backend:** A Node.js/Fastify API to provide high-performance, scalable backend services.
- **Frontend:** Flutter for a single, high-performance, cross-platform user interface that works seamlessly on the web, desktop, and mobile from one codebase.

## Contributing
We believe in building in public and fostering a transparent, community-focused environment. We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels. Here are a few ways you can help:
- **Code Contributions:** Check the issues page for open tasks and bugs.
